Yes, it is possible to create a "completely closed network" or a highly restricted network environment where access to critical systems is tightly controlled. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

### 1. **Isolated Network Architecture**

1. **Private Network**: Set up a private virtual network (VNet) in Azure that is isolated from the public internet. This ensures that resources are only accessible within the VNet or through secure connections.
   - **Azure Virtual Network**: Create an Azure VNet with subnet configurations that isolate different resources (e.g., databases, VMs) within the network.

2. **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Use NSGs to create inbound and outbound security rules to restrict traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
   - **NSG Rules**: Define rules that only allow traffic from specific IP ranges (such as those provided by your VPN) and block all other traffic.

3. **Azure Firewall**: Deploy Azure Firewall to manage and control outbound and inbound traffic for your VNet.
   - **Firewall Policies**: Create firewall policies to restrict access to specific IP addresses and services, and block unwanted traffic.

### 2. **VPN and Access Control**

1. **NordLayer VPN**: Ensure that NordLayer is configured to enforce VPN usage for accessing your network.
   - **VPN Access**: Only allow VPN connections from authorized devices. Configure NordLayer to ensure all traffic must route through the VPN.

2. **IP Whitelisting**: Use IP whitelisting features in Azure and Bitbucket to restrict access to only those IP addresses assigned by your VPN provider.
   - **Azure IP Restrictions**: Configure access controls to allow only VPN-assigned IP addresses.
   - **Bitbucket IP Restrictions**: Configure repository and project settings to only allow access from specific IP ranges.

### 3. **Zero Trust Architecture**

1. **Zero Trust Model**: Implement a Zero Trust security model where no device or user is trusted by default, even if they are inside the network.
   - **Identity and Access Management**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strict identity management policies.
   - **Least Privilege Access**: Ensure that users and devices have the minimum level of access required.

2. **Network Segmentation**: Segment your network into multiple subnets with different security policies. For example, separate subnets for database servers, application servers, and management interfaces.
   - **Private Endpoints**: Use Azure Private Link to connect to Azure services over a private network, avoiding exposure to the public internet.

### 4. **Monitoring and Auditing**

1. **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring tools to keep track of traffic patterns and detect unauthorized access attempts.
   - **Azure Monitor**: Use Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to track and analyze network activity.

2. **Access Auditing**: Regularly audit access logs and review VPN connections and security policies.
   - **Audit Logs**: Monitor logs for unusual or unauthorized access attempts and adjust security policies as necessary.

### 5. **Regular Updates and Testing**

1. **Update Policies**: Regularly update your security policies, firewall rules, and VPN configurations to address new threats.
2. **Security Testing**: Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing to ensure your closed network remains secure.

By combining these strategies, you can create a network environment that is highly secure and restricts access to only authorized users and devices, effectively making it a "closed network."
